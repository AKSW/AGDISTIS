#AGDISTIS

AGDISTIS - Agnostic Named Entity Disambiguation. This projects aimes at delivering a framework for disambiguating a priori annotated named entities. More information about the project can be found here: http://aksw.org/projects/AGDISTIS

Supplementary material can be found in the documents folder.

## Web Service

We deployed AGDISTIS as a RESTful service reachable via the following command:

```shell
curl --data-urlencode "text='The <entity>University of Leipzig</entity> in <entity>Barack Obama</entity>.'" -d type='agdistis' http://139.18.2.164:8080/AGDISTIS
```
or
```shell
curl --data-urlencode "text@test.txt" -d type=agdistis http://139.18.2.164:8080/AGDISTIS
```
AGDISTIS also provides also a Wrapper for DBpedia Spotlight. Just change the "type" to "spotlight" instead of "agdistis"
Please note that every entity you need disambiguated must be recognized beforehand.

Since July 2014 we also provide a chinese endpoint:
```shell
curl --data-urlencode "text='The <entity>shanghai</entity> in <entity>北京市</entity>.'" -d type='agdistis' http://139.18.2.164:8080/AGDISTIS_ZH
```
